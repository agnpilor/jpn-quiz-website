# Kuizu

## Project Description:

Kuizi is a Japanese learning website that offers interactive quizzes that can help Japanese learners. Kuizu will offer
exercises such as multiple choice to fill in the blank, and these will be correspond to the different section of the Genki I textbook. In my university the current website the Japanese course uses is a bit outdated and I wanted to improve on that.

The Kuizu website will offer keeping track of quiz scores for registered users so that users can see their progress. This website will
be fairly simple but I hope for it to be a great learning tool.

This project will be created using React.js for the frontend and Firebase for the database side.
